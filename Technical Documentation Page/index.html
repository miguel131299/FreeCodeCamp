            This chapter discusses JavaScript's basic grammar, variable declarations, data types and literals.
        </p>

        <section id="basics" class="main-section">

            <header>Basics</header>

            <p>
                JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) 
                could be used as a variable name.
            </p>

            <code class="long">let Früh = "foobar"</code>

            <p>
                But, the variable 
                <code>früh</code> 
                is not the same as 
                <code>Früh</code> 
                because JavaScript is case sensitive.
            </p>

            <p>
                In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).
            </p>

            <p>
                A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if
                 more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. 
                This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.
            </p>

            <p>
                The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which
                 are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)
            </p>

        </section>

        <section id="comments" class="main-section">

            <header>Comments</header>

            <p>
                The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
            </p>

            <code class="long">

                <span class="comment">// a one line comment<br></span>

                <span class="comment">
                    /* this is a longer, 
                    * multi-line comment
                    */
                <br>
                </span>

                <span class="comment">/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */</span> 
                
                SyntaxError */

            </code>

            <p>
                Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.
            </p>

        <section id="declarations" class="main-section">

            <header>Declarations</header>

            <p>
                JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.
            </p>

            <dl>

                <dt><code>var</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                </dd>

                <dt><code>let</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                </dd>

                <dt><code>const</code></dt>
                <dd>
                    Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
                </dd>

                <h2>
                    Variables
                </h2>

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (
                    <code>_</code>
                    ), or dollar sign (<code>$</code>). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "<code>A</code>" through "<code>Z</code>
                    " (uppercase) as well as "<code>a</code>" through "<code>z</code>" (lowercase).
                </p>

            </dl>

        <section id="data_structures" class="main-section">

            <header>Data structures and types</header>

            <h2>Data types</h2>

            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>
                    Seven data types that are primitives:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Boolean. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>

                        <li>
                            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
                            <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.)
                        </li>

                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>

                        <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>

                        <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: <code>9007199254740992n</code>.</li>

                        <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>

                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>

                    </ol>

                </li>

                <li>
                    and Object
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. 
                Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers 
                for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section id="literals" class="main-section">

            <header>Literals</header>

            <p>
                Literals represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values—not variables—that you literally provide in your script. 
                This section describes the following types of literals:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>Array literals</li>
                <li>Boolean literals</li>
                <li>Floating-point literals</li>
                <li>Numeric literals</li>
                <li>Object literals</li>
                <li>RegExp literals</li>
                <li>String literals</li>


            </ul>
            
        </section>

                This chapter focuses on basic syntax for declarations and types. To learn more about JavaScript's language constructs, 
                see also the following chapters in this guide:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Control flow and error handling</li>
                <li>Loops and iteration</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>Expressions and operators</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the next chapter, we will have a look at control flow constructs and error handling.</p>
